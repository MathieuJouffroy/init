# It is a network administration tool for querying the Domain Name System (DNS) 
# to obtain domain name or IP address mapping or any other specific DNS record. 
# It is also used to troubleshoot DNS related problems.
# Nslookup has two modes: interactive and non-interactive. 
# Interactive mode allows the user to query name servers for information about 
# various hosts and domains or to print a list of hosts in a domain.

# host or domain.
