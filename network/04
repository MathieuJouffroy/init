# SUBJECT :
# Identifiy the default gateway in the routing table

# INFO : 
# default gateway :  node in a computer network using the internet protocol 
# suite that serves as the forwarding host (router) to other networks when no 
# other route specification matches the destination IP address of a packet.
# A default gateway lets devices in one network to communicate with devices 
# in another network. If your computer, for example, is requesting an internet 
# web page, the request first runs through your default gateway before 
# exiting the local network to reach the internet.

# netstat : 
# Print information about network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, 
# masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.
# -n : shows network addresses as numbers (normally netstat interprets 
# addresses and attempts to display them symbolically). 
# -r : shows the routing tables

# netif = network interfacex

# COMMAND : 
netstat -nr | grep en0 | grep default | awk '{print $2}'
