# SUBJECT:
# Use the output of the previous command to find the name and IP address of the
# device that makes the link between you (local network) and the outside world

# INFO :
# traceroute outputs : 
# Each row represents a "hop" along the route. 
# Think of it as a check-in point where the signal gets its next set of directions.

# format is : Hop #	RTT 1	RTT 2	RTT 3	Name/IP Address
# Hop Number - This is the first column and is simply the number of the hop along the route

# RTT Columns - The next three columns display the round trip time (RTT) for your packet to 
# reach that point and return to your computer. This is listed in milliseconds. 
# There are three columns because the traceroute sends three separate signal packets.

# Domain/IP column - The last column has the IP address of the router.

# DEDUCTION : 
# Network address translation : 
# method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information 
# in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.

# after running the traceroute :
# the 1st line is the local IP address
# the 2nd line : nat1 is the NAT router who makes the link between you (local network) and the outside world
# the 3rd line : the host of our public IP address
traceroute slash16.org | grep nat-1
