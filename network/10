# SUBJECT:
# Identify the network devices between your computer and the slash16.org domain

# INFO :
# traceroute : print the route packets take to network host
# The traceroute command is used in Linux to map the journey that a 
# packet of information undertakes from its source to its destination. 
# One use for traceroute is to locate when data loss occurs throughout 
# a network, which could signify a node that's down.
# Because each hop in the record reflects a new server or router between 
# the originating PC and the intended target, reviewing the results of a 
# traceroute scan also lets you identify slow points that may adversely affect 
# your network traffic.

# COMMAND : 
traceroute slash16.org
