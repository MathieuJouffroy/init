# SUBJECT : 
# Get the list of the network interfaces of the machine 
# without displaying any detail for these interfaces. Only the list of names.

# ifconfig is used to configure, or view the configuration of, a network 
# interface. The -a flag may be used instead of an interface name. This flag 
# instructs ifconfig to display information about all interfaces in the system. 
# The -l flag may be used to list all available interfaces on the system, with 
# no other additional information.

# COMMAND :
ifconfig -l
