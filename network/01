# SUBJECT : 
# Get the list of the network interfaces of the machine 
# without displaying any detail for these interfaces. Only the list of names.

# INFO : 

# ifconfig is a command line interface tool for network interface configuration 
# and also used to initialize an interfaces at system boot time. 

# Once a server is up and running, it can be used to assign an IP Address 
# to an interface and enable or disable the interface on demand.
# It is also used to view the status IP Address, Hardware / MAC address, 
# as well as MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) size of the currently active interfaces. 
# ifconfig is thus useful for debugging or performing system tuning.
#
# The -a flag may be used instead of an interface name. This flag 
# instructs ifconfig to display information about all interfaces in the system. 

# The -l flag may be used to list all available interfaces on the system, with 
# no other additional information.

# COMMAND :
ifconfig -l
